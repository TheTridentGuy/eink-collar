# eink-collar
A collar with an e-ink display, perfect for use as a hackathon badge! It consists of a collar with a flexible e-ink display on it, and a 
leash with a Raspberry Pi Zero and e-ink driver HAT. You can connect the leash to program it, and disconnect it to stand alone, or keep the leash connected, and somehow powered to have a dynamic collar.
You could even make a pwnagotchi collar!
